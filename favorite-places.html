        <p>With a history going back to 1907, Pike Place Market has farmers’ stands for seasonal produce, a wealth of permanent produce stalls, four fish markets, dozens of specialty food stores for hard-to-find ingredients, a crafts market with more than 200 traders and an absurd amount of places to eat.

        <h2>Space Needle</h2>

        <p>When it went up in 1962 it was the tallest building west of the Mississippi, standing at 158 metres (184 with spire). You’ll ascend the tower in a glass elevator to the observation deck at 160 metres, where you can ponder the Seattle’s towers, Mount Rainier, the islands on Puget Sound, the Cascade Mountains and the Olympic Mountains.<a href="http://www.spaceneedle.com">Check out website here...</a></p>

    <p>This Modernist cityscape was all built for the 1962 World’s Fair, which gave a shot in the arm to the city’s economy and cultural life, and pulled in more than 2.3 million visitors.</p>
